# Student Record Management System (C)

## Overview
A menu-driven application developed in C to manage student records efficiently.  
The project focuses on applying core programming concepts such as structured data handling, file operations, and modular design, along with basic analytical and usability enhancements.

---
##  Features
- Add and display student records using structured data
- Automatic academic status evaluation (*At Risk*, *Pass*, *Distinction*)
- Smart search with partial and case-insensitive matching
- Persistent data storage using file handling
- Audit trail to log record additions and modifications

## Novel Features
- **Academic Status Analyzer:** Evaluates student performance based on marks to provide meaningful academic categorization.
- **Smart Search:** Allows flexible record retrieval through partial and case-insensitive keyword matching.
- **Change Log (Audit Trail):** Maintains a timestamped log of record changes to ensure traceability.
- **Modular Design:** Organizes logic into clearly defined functions for better readability and maintainability.

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc student_record.c -o student_record
2. Run the executable:
   ./student_record
